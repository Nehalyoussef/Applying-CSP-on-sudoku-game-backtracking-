The goal of this project is to solve Sudoku puzzles using algorithms from the field of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) and backtracking. Sudoku is a logic-based puzzle where you fill a 9x9 grid with numbers so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.
A Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) is a mathematical problem defined by a set of variables, each with a domain of values, and a set of constraints specifying allowable combinations of values.
In the context of Sudoku:

Variables: The cells of the Sudoku grid.
Domains: The possible values each cell can take, which are the numbers 1 through 9.
Constraints: The rules that must be followed:
Each number must appear exactly once in each row.
Each number must appear exactly once in each column.
Each number must appear exactly once in each 3x3 subgrid.
Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding solutions to CSPs.It backtracks as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.backtracking works as follows:

1)Select an empty cell: Choose an empty cell in the grid to fill.
2)Try a number: Place a number (1-9) in the cell.
3)Check constraints: Check if the number violates any Sudoku rules.
If it does, try the next number.
If it doesn't, move on to the next empty cell.
4)Backtrack if necessary: If no valid number can be placed in a cell, backtrack to the previous cell and try a different number there.
5)Repeat: Continue this process until the grid is completely and correctly filled, or until all possibilities are exhausted (indicating no solution).
